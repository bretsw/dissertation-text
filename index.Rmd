This research proposal was guided by my dissertation co-chairs, Matthew Koehler and Christine Greenhow, and committee members, Ralph Putnam and Gail Richmond. This online version was created with the **bookdown** package (Xie, 2019a) in R, which in turn was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** (Xie, 2019b).
