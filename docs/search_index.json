With many more opportunities for professional learning available today, new teachers must navigate an increased number of potentially conflicting messages about what and how to teach. This study explores the support systems that new teachers construct during induction and how they use social media for this purpose. These systems can be understood as professional learning networks (PLNs) consisting of tools, people, and spaces and useful for improving teaching and learning. Interviews with new teachers provide evidence of reasons why they develop PLNs as well as what tools, people, and spaces they include in these support systems. Findings demonstrate that new teachers construct induction support systems to navigate change, scarcity of resources, and conflicting teaching beliefs. New teachers look for tools for planning, enacting practice in the classroom, and connecting socially. People in new teachers’ PLNs included both in-school and out-of-school connections. Interviewees described how they use various social media platforms in their induction support systems as well as boundaries they maintain around social media use. Finally, new teachers described their engagement on social media in terms of browsing, asking, and exchanging. Implications of these findings are discussed for new teachers, teacher educators, and education leaders—especially regarding how stakeholders can help alleviate induction pressures on new teachers. This study contributes insight into the convergence of tensions experienced by new teachers as they consider whether and how to construct support systems during induction, including if and how to look for help on social media. 2.1 Keywords teacher induction, professional learning network, learning ecology, agency, teacher professional development, social media "],["introduction.html", "3 Introduction", " 3 Introduction New teachers face numerous challenges during their transition from teacher preparation programs into professional employment contexts (i.e., their induction period). At minimum, new teachers must move from learning about teaching to actually practicing teaching. The difficulties of this transition may be compounded when new teachers enter their school of employment with notions of teaching that are not shared—or in some instances, are even actively discouraged—by more experienced colleagues. The literature has characterized this tension as a “two worlds pitfall” (Feiman-Nemser &amp; Buchmann, 1985) caused by conflicting messages from the academic “world” of the teacher preparation program and the practical “world” of the professional teaching context. Furthermore, it seems likely that tensions have only increased as people and information have become more connected through digital technologies. Social media platforms, in particular, have created new opportunities for teachers’ ongoing learning (Trust &amp; Prestridge, 2021). With many more contexts for professional learning now available, new teachers must navigate an increased number of potentially conflicting messages about what and how to teach. The purpose of this study is to explore the support systems that new teachers construct during induction and how they use social media for this purpose. These systems can be understood as professional learning networks (PLNs) consisting of tools, people, and spaces useful for improving teaching and learning (Krutka et al., 2017; Trust et al., 2016; Trust &amp; Prestridge, 2021). Teachers form their PLNs from a subset of all possible tools, people, and spaces available, because no one person can learn with all tools from all people in all spaces. For instance, a recent count showed that there are more than 900 distinct education-related Twitter hashtags (Participate Inc., 2019), which organize spaces for ongoing conversations about teaching and learning (Greenhalgh et al. 2020). These are spaces on just one social media platform; there are many more, including 16 distinct, teaching-related discussion forums comprising the Reddit Education Network (Staudt Willet &amp; Carpenter, 2020, 2021), many teacher Facebook groups, Instagram hashtags, and so on. Innumerable people participate in these many spaces, sharing tools that might provide useful support to teachers. There is a gap in how the literature has covered new teachers’ challenges and support systems. Research on teacher induction has primarily focused on support systems of tools, people, and spaces that exist within formal programs. This body of work has not fully considered implications of recent technological advancements that may create more expansive opportunities for—and new complications of—new teachers’ support systems. Meanwhile, research on teachers’ use of social media has rarely taken into account the specific needs of new teachers as they transition into teaching. This study addresses the gap in the literature by specifically addressing both induction challenges and social media practices of new teachers. This work is able to then contribute recommendations to teacher educators and education leaders regarding how to sustain new teachers in the profession. These insights are important because even prior to the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, teachers had been leaving the classroom at an unprecedented rate (Carver-Thomas &amp; Darling-Hammond, 2017; Hackman &amp; Morath, 2018), with especially high attrition among new teachers (Ronfeldt &amp; McQueen, 2017). Induction challenges continue to grow, and new teachers’ ability to develop and sustain robust PLNs (i.e., supports systems) must expand as well. "],["framework.html", "4 Framework", " 4 Framework This study is framed with a PLN lens, focusing on new teachers’ support systems in terms of tools, people, and spaces that help improve teaching and learning (Krutka et al., 2017; Trust et al., 2016; Trust &amp; Prestridge, 2021). The PLN concept has roots in situated learning theories, which assert that learning occurs within specific contexts (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991; Putnam &amp; Borko, 2000). Lave and Wenger (1991) described learning as an apprenticeship, a process wherein a newcomer becomes a member of a community of practice. This view of learning-as-situated foregrounds the individual learner; for PLNs, this means focusing on a single teacher who connects to tools, people, and spaces to support and improve their ongoing professional learning. The tools shared in PLNs are useful for teachers’ professional learning and may include knowledge, skills, teaching resources, curricular materials, and encouragement. These tools are shared by people, both individuals and groups, with whom a new teacher can connect through various spaces (e.g., school of employment, district workshops, social media platforms). Teachers’ willingness to voluntarily construct PLNs in addition to required professional development suggests that there are underlying reasons that justify spending extra time and effort beyond the regular demands of the teaching profession. In sum, a PLN can be understood in terms of why (i.e., underlying reasons) a teacher constructs a support system, what they are looking for (i.e., tools for professional learning), from whom (i.e., people), and where (i.e., spaces). A PLN lens is well-suited to frame this study because it foregrounds teachers’ professional learning while expanding the scope of tools and people to potentially include those accessed through emergent spaces like social media. PLNs include elements of traditional professional development in addition to informal learning possibilities (Krutka et al., 2017; Prestridge, 2019; Trust et al., 2016), spanning local and global spaces (Trust et al., 2016). The mix of face-to-face, online, formal, and informal elements highlighted by a PLN framework has the potential to address the gap between research on teacher induction and research on teachers’ use of social media. Two other frameworks intersect with the PLN concept and offer additional insight: learning ecology and agency. First, the many spaces comprising a new teacher’s PLN can be understood as a learning ecology: “the set of contexts found in physical or virtual spaces that provide opportunities for learning” (Barron, 2006, p. 195). In other words, a learning ecology emphasizes the spatial component of a PLN, highlighting that PLNs are composed of interconnected and mutually influential spaces, with the individual teacher at the center (Figure 1). Disparate pieces of a PLN fit together to make a whole (Barron, 2006; Stevenson et al., 2019; Veletsianos et al., 2019) and may change over time (Carpenter et al., 2021; Veletsianos et al., 2019). For instance, a new teacher may start asking teaching-related questions in the r/Teachers subreddit and learn about policy issues in the r/education subreddit (Staudt Willet &amp; Carpenter, 2021) to complement a recent district professional development workshop discussing new expectations for teaching to standards. In cases like this, participating in informal contexts can support and influence learning in formal contexts (Peters &amp; Romero, 2019). Figure 1. Spaces for New Teachers’ Professional Learning PLNs are “uniquely cultivated” (Trust &amp; Prestridge, 2021, p. 1), meaning each teacher makes their own choices about how to construct their support system from a subset of all tools, people, and spaces available to them (i.e., why they access some contexts but not others). These choices in PLN construction are a way that teachers exercise agency. Agency may be understood as the ability to take intentional and purposeful actions, which are “influenced by experiences, beliefs, values, and goals in conjunction with the context” (Wray &amp; Richmond, 2018, p. 3). An agentic perspective highlights how a new teacher is responsible for ensuring that the PLN they construct meets their induction needs. Agency focuses attention on how teachers are able “to play a part in their self-development, adaptation, and self-renewal with changing times” (Bandura, 2001, p. 2). For instance, if a new teacher had difficulty contextualizing the content of a district professional development workshop, it would be up to them to talk to colleagues in the teachers’ lounge, ask a mentor teacher, or see what answers they could find through social media. In sum, this study considers new teachers’ construction of support systems with a PLN frame, taking into account ecological and agentic perspectives. Social media have greatly increased access to potential tools, people, and spaces that might help new teachers navigate induction challenges. An ecological perspective spotlights the relationship between various PLN components, and an agentic perspective draws attention to new teachers’ intentionality in choosing some components to add to their PLN, but not others.
